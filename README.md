# Denoising_and_Deblurring_of_a_signal
  
# Introduction-
This code contains an algorithm to get required output after denoising and deblurring of the given signals without using any inbuilt function which is solved using 2 different approaches.


# Requirements-
* python 3+
* Libraries - Matplotlib , Numpy , CSV , Cmath

# Installation-
* For installing pip command run 'sudo apt install python3-pip'
* For installing numpy run 'pip3 install numpy'
* For installing Matplotlib Library run 'pip install matplotlib'
* The csv module is included in the Python installation

# Importing Libraries-
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* import numpy as np
* import cmath
* import csv

# Recommendation-
* Run code in pycharm community edition by installing mentioned Libraries  
While executing code make sure the csv file is in the same folder in which main.py file is present

# Code execution-  
* Click on run command on pycharm, right click on the current file name then click on RUN 'final' option to execute the command.
* Alternatively, the code can be run on pycharm using the keyboard shortcut - Shift+Alt+F10.
* Also after running, next graph can only be viewed after closing the current graph.
